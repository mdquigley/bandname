# Bandname

A very simple site that checks if a [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) subdomain is available.  
Uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and a [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) proxy ~~running on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)~~
Heroku removed all free plans in November 2022, breaking Bandname. An alternative proxy server needs to be setup.
